Currently the iPad and iPhone versions provide different demos.

###IPhone
There are 3 demos included. Change the initial view controller in the main iPhone storyboard to see them each.

###iPad
On the first tab, there are buttons to change both the interactive and the animated transition styles. Note that shake is not yet implemented.

##TODO
- Implement Shake Interactor
- Unify the iPhone and iPad storyboards so that both have all demos available.
- Fix the black screen flash on RMZoom animations.
